<h1  style="text-align: center;">Adriano Bro I know you will visit this domain Please, I am very stressed due to my financial problems. Donâ€™t treat me like this. I worked so hard to complete your task, and even after that, I waited 21 days for you to come online. I admit that I sent many messages, but please also consider that I waited so long for you. Iâ€™m sorry for that, and you have the right to be upset, but that doesnâ€™t mean you shouldnâ€™t pay me at all. Iâ€™m already very worried. Please contact me on WhatsApp and make the payment It seems like you stayed offline for 21 days intentionally. I had a feeling that maybe you were going through some personal problem, but then you came back, released $300, closed the account, and disappeared. But you know very well that you still owe me $1000, which makes it seem like this was intentional.

Whatever the reason may be, the fact remains that you owe me $1000. I'm not saying you committed fraud, but I will definitely say that you have treated me unfairly. I hope God puts some compassion for me in your heart, and that you contact me on WhatsApp and return $1000 total.

My WhatsApp number and email are below. Please donâ€™t let my reward for 21 days of hard and honest work end like this. Youâ€™re a good person, and I didnâ€™t expect this from you.ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”</h1>
