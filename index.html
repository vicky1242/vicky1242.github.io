    <h1  style="text-align: center;">I have contact with freelancer and they said that The client claims that there is no pending payment and not all of the project scope was provided. He also stated the he could have filed for a dispute but decided not to</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Why are you acting like this? I never thought of you this way—I had so much trust in you. If there's any issue, please let me know. If there's a problem with the work, tell me. If you don’t have the payment right now, just say so. If you've gone through any tragedy, share that too. You know I’m not like that, and I also believe you're not like this either. Something must have happened with you. You can share it with me—we can work through it together. As for money, it will come and go. Please contact me on WhatsApp.</h1>
