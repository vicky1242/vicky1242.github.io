    <h1  style="text-align: center;">I have contacted the people at Freelancer. They are saying that you're claiming the files are not complete. First of all, the files are complete. Secondly, if you're having trouble running them, I can help you with that. And if you're genuinely telling the truth that the files are incomplete, then I will check what the issue is.

I am an honest person, and the files are complete — maybe you're just facing some issue while trying to run them. You should have contacted me; I would have resolved your issue.

You never told me even once that the files were incomplete. Instead, you released the $300, closed your account, and left without even replying to me. And now you're telling Freelancer that the files were incomplete — when you should have told me that directly.</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Why are you doing like this? I never thought of you this way—I had so much trust in you. If there's any issue, please let me know. If there's a problem with the work, tell me. If you don’t have the payment right now, just say so. If you've gone through any tragedy, share that too. You know I’m not like that, and I also believe you're not like this either. Something must have happened with you. You can share it with me—we can work through it together. As for money, it will come and go. Please contact me on WhatsApp.</h1>
