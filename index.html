    <h1  style="text-align: center;">I have contacted freelancer support again, and they are saying that the files are not in HTML or CSS; everything is fully imported from external files. I had already told you that I cloned it from there, but I don’t understand why you are upset now. Still, I am an honest person. Please contact me—I will recreate everything in pure HTML, CSS, and JS within 2 days, and I will do it myself.

We’ve worked so well together for a year; we shouldn’t end things like this. You’ve already paid me 300, and 700 remains. Once the work is complete, you can pay me the rest..I am an honest person—your 300 won’t go to waste. If the site files seem useless to you, then I will create the same thing you originally requested, with the same design, in HTML and CSS within 2 days. You didn’t even mention that there was an issue—you just left, upset.</h1>
